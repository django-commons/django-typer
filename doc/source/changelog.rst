Change Log
==========

v4.0.0 (2026-09-XX)
===================

* Support Typer 0.26.8+
* Added :attr:`~django_typer.management.TyperCommand.atomic` to run a command's whole
  invocation - initializer, chained subcommands and finalizer - in a database transaction.
  Implements `Add a command option that will wrap execute() in a transaction
  <https://github.com/django-commons/django-typer/issues/219>`_. See :ref:`atomic`.
* Fixed chain mode being switched off when a chained command defines an initializer
* Implemented `ModelObjectParser should have a setting that returns the lookup value if no row
  was found. <https://github.com/django-commons/django-typer/issues/218>`_ - see the
  ``return_lookup_on_miss`` parameter. The return value of ``on_error`` handlers is now
  documented as the parsed value.
* The click command tree Typer builds for a command is now cached per app and only rebuilt
  when commands, groups, callbacks or finalizers are registered, instead of being rebuilt
  several times on every invocation
* Fixed `typer.Exit is swallowed on the execute() path: exit code returned as output and
  process exits 0 <https://github.com/django-commons/django-typer/issues/318>`_
* Fixed `Avoid redundant context construction <https://github.com/django-commons/django-typer/issues/210>`_
* Fixed `FileBinaryRead: file is already closed <https://github.com/django-commons/django-typer/issues/209>`_
* Fixed `Typer app options do not inherit/override correctly
  <https://github.com/django-commons/django-typer/issues/256>`_
* Drop dependency on Click (vendored by Typer). The Click types needed to write completers
  and parsers are re-exported from :mod:`django_typer.completers` (``Context``, ``Parameter``,
  ``CompletionItem``) and :mod:`django_typer.parsers` (``Context``, ``Parameter``, ``ParamType``)
* Drop support for Python 3.10
* BREAKING: Values returned from commands are no longer written to stdout by default. Set
  ``print_result = True`` on a command, or ``DT_PRINT_RESULT = True`` in settings, to restore
  the previous behavior.
* Fixed result printing being applied to the wrong stream: with ``print_result`` off the
  returned value was still written when ``stdout=`` was passed to
  :func:`~django.core.management.call_command`, and a command instance reused after a run
  dropped its own output.
* Passing a ``prompt_required=False`` option flag without a value no longer triggers
  the prompt - Typer's vendored Click dropped support for this. Omit the flag to be
  prompted or pass the value explicitly.
* Fixed `Fix documentation PDF build <https://github.com/django-commons/django-typer/issues/228>`_
* Documented `installing shell completion for a just manage script <https://github.com/django-commons/django-typer/issues/190>`_ and other wrapped invocations, see :ref:`wrapped_invocations`. Multi-word manage scripts remain unsupported (`#191 <https://github.com/django-commons/django-typer/issues/191>`_).
* Fixed `get_usage_script resolves full path when command is resolvable on path <https://github.com/django-commons/django-typer/issues/310>`_ and added the ``DJANGO_MANAGE_SCRIPT`` setting to override the detected program name.


Migrating from 3.x to 4.x
-------------------------

* Python 3.10 is no longer supported, 4.x requires Python 3.11 or later.

* Typer_ 0.26.8 or later is required and Click_ is no longer a dependency of django-typer_. Typer_
  now vendors Click_, so the ``click`` package may not be installed in your environment and even
  when it is, its classes are not the ones Typer_ uses. If your commands import from ``click``:

  - Import the types used to write completers from :mod:`django_typer.completers`:

    .. code-block:: python

        # 3.x
        from click import Context, Parameter
        from click.shell_completion import CompletionItem

        # 4.x
        from django_typer.completers import CompletionItem, Context, Parameter

  - Import the types used to write parsers from :mod:`django_typer.parsers`:

    .. code-block:: python

        # 3.x
        from click import Context, Parameter, ParamType

        # 4.x
        from django_typer.parsers import Context, Parameter, ParamType

  - Use ``typer.Exit``, ``typer.Abort`` and ``typer.BadParameter`` in place of their ``click``
    counterparts. Raising :exc:`~django.core.management.CommandError` remains the recommended
    way to report errors from a command.

  - Replace calls to ``click.get_current_context()`` with a parameter annotated as
    :class:`~django_typer.management.Context` on the command, group or callback that needs it,
    Typer_ will pass the active context in. :func:`~django_typer.utils.get_current_command`
    continues to provide the running command instance.

  - ``isinstance`` checks against ``click`` classes will no longer match.

  - The ``click_type`` parameter to ``typer.Option`` and ``typer.Argument`` was removed upstream,
    pass the type to ``parser`` instead. Parsers already passed through ``parser`` are unaffected:
    plain callables and ``ParamType`` subclasses, including ones derived from a separately
    installed Click_, continue to work.

* Options declared with ``prompt=True, prompt_required=False`` no longer prompt when the flag is
  passed without a value, doing so is now a usage error. Omit the flag to be prompted or pass
  the value explicitly.

* If you document your commands with the ``typer`` directive from sphinxcontrib-typer_, upgrade
  it to 0.10 or later. Earlier releases drive the real Click_ package and fail against
  Typer_ 0.26+.

* The program name shown in the ``Usage:`` line of command help (and used when installing shell
  completions) is now the bare command name whenever that name resolves on the path, including when
  the script was launched through a shim or wrapper of the same name or through a relative path to
  the same script. Previously the full path was shown in these cases. Set
  ``DJANGO_MANAGE_SCRIPT`` to pin the name if you need a specific value, see
  :ref:`configure-manage-script`.

* :exc:`typer.Exit`, :exc:`typer.Abort` and :exc:`KeyboardInterrupt` leaving a command now
  follow one policy. From the command line the process exits with the status (``Abort``
  prints ``Aborted!`` and exits 1, an interrupt exits 130) and nothing else is printed.
  From :func:`~django.core.management.call_command`, a non-zero ``Exit`` and an ``Abort`` raise
  :exc:`~django.core.management.CommandError` with ``returncode`` set, and ``Exit(0)``
  returns ``None``. Command functions called directly from Python are plain calls and
  whatever they raise propagates unchanged. Previously ``Exit`` was returned (and printed)
  as the command's output when executed and ended the process when the command object was
  called directly. See :ref:`exit_behavior`.

* Return values are no longer printed. In 3.x a truthy value returned from a command was
  written to stdout, mirroring :class:`~django.core.management.BaseCommand`. In 4.x nothing
  is printed unless the command sets ``print_result = True`` or the project sets
  ``DT_PRINT_RESULT = True`` - see :ref:`print_result`. If a command's return value doubled
  as its output, set one of those or write the output explicitly.

* No changes are required for chained groups (``chain=True``), finalizers, the provided
  completers and parsers, custom shell completer classes registered with
  :func:`~django_typer.shells.register_completion_class` or the shellcompletion command. These
  were reimplemented or adapted internally and behave as before.

    automatically now.
  * If you want to disable rich:

    1. **At runtime**: you can set the environment variable ``TYPER_USE_RICH`` to ``0`` or
       ``false``.
    2. **In code (for all invocations)**: you can set the class variable ``rich_markup_mode`` to
       ``None`` on your command class or any parent group. This will disable rich for that command
       and all subcommands.

* You may also run into an `error like this <https://github.com/fastapi/typer/issues/1537>`_:

Migrating from 2.x to 3.x
-------------------------

* Imports from the ``django_typer`` namespace have been removed. You should now import from
  ``django_typer.management``.

* The `name` parameter has been removed from
  :func:`django_typer.management.initialize()` and :func:`django_typer.management.Typer.callback()`.
  This change was forced by `upstream changes <https://github.com/fastapi/typer/pull/1052>`_ in
  Typer_ that will allow :func:`django_typer.management.Typer.add_typer` to define commands across
  multiple files.

* Rich tracebacks will not include local variables by default. To replicate the old behavior
  you will need to add this to your settings:

  .. code-block:: python

      RICH_TRACEBACK_CONFIG={"show_locals": True}

  --show-locals and --hide-locals common parameters are added to toggle local variables on
  and off in the stack trace output.

Shell Completions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table:: **Some imports have changed in the django_typer namespace!**
  :widths: 50 50
  :header-rows: 1

  * - old
    - new
  * - ``management.model_parser_completer``
    - ``utils.model_parser_completer``
  * - ``parsers.ModelObjectParser``
    - ``parsers.model.ModelObjectParser``
  * - ``parsers.parse_app_label``
    - ``parsers.apps.app_config``
  * - ``completers.complete_app_label``
    - ``completers.apps.app_labels``
  * - ``completers.commands``
    - ``completers.cmd.commands``
  * - ``completers.databases``
    - ``completers.db.databases``
  * - ``completers.ModelObjectCompleter``
    - ``completers.model.ModelObjectCompleter``
  * - ``completers.complete_path``
    - ``completers.path.paths``
  * - ``completers.complete_directory``
    - ``completers.path.directories``
  * - ``completers.complete_import_path``
    - ``completers.path.import_paths``

* If you are using shell tab completions you will need to reinstall the completion scripts. Using
  the `shellcompletion install` command. To be extra safe you may want to uninstall the old
  scripts before updating, using the v2.x ``shellcompletion remove`` command.

* The interface to shellcompletion has changed. ``--shell`` is now an initialization option and
  ``remove`` was renamed to ``uninstall``.:

    .. code-block::

        # old interface
        manage shellcompletion complete --shell zsh "command string"
        manage shellcompletion remove

        # new interface
        manage shellcompletion --shell zsh complete "command string"
        manage shellcompletion uninstall

* The function signature for :ref:`shellcompletion fallbacks <completion_fallbacks>` has changed.
  The fallback signature is now:

    .. code-block::

        import typing as t
        from click.shell_complete import CompletionItem

        def fallback(args: t.List[str], incomplete: str) -> t.List[CompletionItem]:
            ...
