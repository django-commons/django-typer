============
Django Typer
============

Use static typing to define the CLI for your Django_ management commands with Typer_. Optionally
use the provided :class:`~django_typer.management.TyperCommand` class that inherits from
:class:`~django.core.management.BaseCommand`. This class maps the Typer_ interface onto a class
based interface that Django developers will be familiar with. All of the
:class:`~django.core.management.BaseCommand` functionality is inherited, so that
:class:`~django_typer.management.TyperCommand` can be a drop in replacement.

**django-typer makes it easy to:**

    * Define your command CLI interface in a clear, DRY and safe way using type hints
    * Create subcommands and hierarchical groups of commands.
    * Use the full power of Typer_'s parameter types to validate and parse command line inputs.
    * Create beautiful and information dense help outputs.
    * Configure the rendering of exception stack traces using :doc:`rich <rich:index>`.
    * :ref:`Install shell tab-completion support <shellcompletions>` for bash_, zsh_, fish_ and
      powershell_.
    * :ref:`Create custom and portable shell tab-completions for your CLI parameters.
      <define-shellcompletions>`
    * Port existing commands (:class:`~django_typer.management.TyperCommand` is interface compatible
      with :class:`~django.core.management.BaseCommand`).
    * Use either a Django-style class-based interface or the Typer-style interface to define
      commands.
    * Add plugins to upstream commands.

.. warning::

    **Imports from** ``django_typer`` **have been deprecated and will be removed in 3.0!** Imports
    have moved to ``django_typer.management``:

    .. code-block::

        # old way
        from django_typer import TyperCommand, command, group, initialize, Typer

        # new way!
        from django_typer.management import TyperCommand, command, group, initialize, Typer

:big:`Installation`

1. Clone django-typer from GitHub_ or install a release off PyPI_ :

    .. code:: bash

        pip install django-typer

    :doc:`rich <rich:index>` is a powerful library for rich text and beautiful formatting in the terminal.
    It is not required, but highly recommended for the best experience:

    .. code:: bash

        pip install "django-typer[rich]"


2. Optionally add ``django_typer`` to your :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS` setting:

    .. code:: python

        INSTALLED_APPS = [
            ...
            'django_typer',
        ]

   *You only need to install django_typer as an app if you want to use the shellcompletion command
   to enable tab-completion or if you would like django-typer to install*
   :ref:`rich traceback rendering <configure-rich-exception-tracebacks>` *for you - which it does
   by default if rich is also installed.*

.. note::

    This documentation shows all examples using both the function oriented Typer-style interface
    and the class based Django-style interface in separate tabs. Each interface is functionally
    equivalent so the choice of which to use is a matter of preference and familiarity. All
    django-typer commands are instances of :class:`~django_typer.management.TyperCommand`,
    including commands defined in the Typer-style interface. **This means you may always specify a
    self argument to receive the instance of the command in your functions.**

:big:`Basic Example`

:class:`~django_typer.management.TyperCommand` is a drop in extension to
:class:`~django.core.management.BaseCommand`. All of the documented features of
:class:`~django.core.management.BaseCommand` work the same way! Or, you may also use an interface
identical to Typer_'s. Simply import Typer_ from django_typer instead of typer.

:big:`Multiple Subcommands Example`

Commands with multiple subcommands can be defined:

    :prog: ./manage.py multi
    :width: 80
    :show-nested:
    :convert-png: latex
    :theme: dark

:big:`Grouping and Hierarchies Example`

Or more complex groups and subcommand hierarchies can be defined. For example this command
defines a group of commands called math, with subcommands divide and multiply. The group
has a common initializer that optionally sets a float precision value. We would invoke this
command like so:

.. code:: bash

    ./manage.py hierarchy math --precision 5 divide 10 2.1
    4.76190
    ./manage.py hierarchy math multiply 10 2
    20.00

Any number of groups and subcommands and subgroups of other groups can be defined allowing for
arbitrarily complex command hierarchies. The Typer-style interface builds a
:class:`~django_typer.management.TyperCommand` class for us **that allows you to optionally accept
the self argument in your commands.**
