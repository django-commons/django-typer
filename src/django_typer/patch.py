"""
Stuffing the typer interface into the Django
:class:`~django.core.management.BaseCommand` interface is an exercise in fitting a
square peg into a round hole. A small amount of upstream patching is required to make
this work. All monkey patching is defined in this module to more easily keep track of
it.

Mostly because typer does not allow direct access to the rich console objects it
creates we need to do some monkey patching to get the desired behavior when
:option:`--no-color` options or :option:`--force-color` options are specified

apply() needs to be called before any imports from Typer

.. todo::

    Revisit this if Typer exposes control of the console objects.

To achieve expected :option:`--force-color` and :option:`--no-color` behavior there are
3 different console objects installed when rich is used:

- The first is the global exception handler installed by rich - see apps.py
- The second is the command exception handler console installed by typer - see below
- The third is the console used by the command itself to output helps - see below
