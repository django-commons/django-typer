django-typer_ provides an extension class, :class:`~django_typer.TyperCommand`, to the
BaseCommand_ class that melds the Typer_/click_ infrastructure with
the Django_ infrastructure. The result is all the ease of specifying commands, groups
and options and arguments using Typer_ and click_ in a way that feels like and is
interface compatible with Django_'s BaseCommand_ This should enable a smooth transition
for existing Django_ commands and an intuitive feel for implementing new commands.

django-typer_ also supports shell completion for bash_, zsh_, fish_ and powershell_ and
extends that support to native Django_ management commands as well.


The goal of django-typer_ is to provide full Typer_ style functionality while maintaining
compatibility with the Django management command system. This means that the BaseCommand_
interface is preserved and the Typer_ interface is added on top of it. This means that
this code base is more robust to changes in the Django management command system - because
most of the base class functionality is preserved but many Typer_ and click_ internals are
used directly to achieve this. We rely on robust CI to catch breaking changes upstream and
keep a tight version lock on Typer.
