    against a virtual screen and gives us back what's actually visible.

    The virtual screen is intentionally far wider than the PTY (which is 80
    cols). Shells often wrap long input/output implicitly when the cursor
    runs past the PTY's last column -- the byte stream contains no newline,
    so a virtual screen matching the PTY would split the text. A wider

    The manage script is run through a wrapper command on the path that forwards to
    ``python manage.py``, the way a ``just manage`` recipe or ``poetry run manage``
    would, and the ``DJANGO_MANAGE_SCRIPT`` setting names the wrapper. This is the
    documented way to get completions for wrapped invocations:

    https://github.com/django-commons/django-typer/issues/190
    https://github.com/django-commons/django-typer/issues/191

    Unlike the other installed script tests, install and uninstall do not pass
    ``--manage-script`` - the setting must drive detection, because the script the
    wrapper launches is not the command the user types.

    Only the tests whose code paths the wrapper changes are kept, the rest are covered
    by the exe tests.
